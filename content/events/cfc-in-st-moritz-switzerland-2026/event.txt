    The downfall of major crypto companies,

    the geographic and product focus of

    experience in the Americas, Europe, and
    Asia to explore the most salient
    regional, technical, regulatory,
    business, and cultural developments,
    impacting the crypto industry. Are we
    closer to stability to allow the
    industry to flourish, or what more needs

    Crypto industry leaders worldwide have
    called for smart regulation of digital
    assets. There has been a concerted
    effort in EMEA and APAC to allow
    innovation to flourish under supportive
    legal frameworks. Are businesses and
    investors in the industry finding the
    certainty they need from regulatory
    developments thus far, and what else
    should they seek from policymakers?

What are the driving forces behind their policies and what role do actual crypto companies play in this process?'

    The actions of the SEC, CFTC and other

    the potential negative impact this may
    have on the U.S.’ status as a leader
    in tech, innovation, and investments.
    What’s the outlook of the leaders in
    the industry?

    In previous years, we discovered and

    footprint, specifically focusing on
    mining and energy-intensive consensus
    mechanisms. As the original catalyst for
    the burgeoning crypto finance world, how
    will the halving, set for April 2024,
    impact the future of Bitcoin and what
    role will Bitcoin play in an
    increasingly climate-conscious world?

  description: >
    Decentralization is the fundamental
    principle of cryptocurrency. Yet, too
    often it’s described as black and
    white. We discuss the relativism and
    nuance of decentralization, why digital
    assets (and especially money) should be
    decentralized in the first place, how
    decentralization is typically at odds
    with regulation, and why
    decentralization is so powerful – and
    perhaps, unstoppable?

    Leveraging computers and online data to

    artificial intelligence will bring
    countless benefits to society, while
    also presenting specific challenges. How
    will the rise of AI intersect with the
    world of crypto finance and how will
    blockchain technology advance as a
    result of AI’s seemingly limitless
    potential?

    The digital transformation of capital

    the financial services industry. How do
    those at the forefront of this kind of

Christopher Giancarlo, former Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will make the case that the choice for free people is not one or the other. It is rather between financial freedom and economic liberty – if we get it right – and capricious political control and big tech coercion and censorship, if we don't."

    Central Bank Digital Currencies went
    from being proposed as an innovative
    financial tool, to being critiqued by
    privacy advocates. Despite this, over
    130 countries are moving forward with
    CBDC projects. At the same time,
    stablecoins are gaining traction in more
    sectors than crypto settlement because
    of reduced friction and supervision
    (e.g., large enterprises and retail
    users). What is the right level of
    supervision of these kinds of
    innovations, and can central bank and
    private money coexist?

Mainstream media have portrayed it as something with little economic value or a recent desperate attempt by exchanges to diversify their revenue streams in crypto winter. In this roundtable, David Olsson, Kraken’s Head of OTC Lending, will open the floor to discuss the role lending can play in a vibrant, healthy crypto ecosystem. How it can create fresh opportunities for long-time holders, and open up the asset class to new entrants. In addition, there’ll be discussion around the different lending models, how they meet institutional client needs and can future-proof against crises, as experienced in 2022."

With the maturation of private, custom blockchains that are already being used for use cases such as digital ID, tokenization of real world assets, and much more, it has now become extremely convenient and easy for any entity to deploy their own blockchain.

  hide_description: 'false'
  hide_speakers: 'false'
  description: >
    Countries around the world are
    increasingly focused on developing rules
    and standards for digital assets. A
    closer look into these frameworks, both
    being proposed and implemented, reveals
    regulatory frictions inherent to
    harmonized jurisdictional regimes. While
    individually they seek to address
    similar policy objectives, the lack of
    alignment across principles could
    counteract intended benefits, create
    unwanted extraterritorial impacts, and
    risk continued global regulatory
    fragmentation and increased arbitrage
    opportunities. Global policymakers and
    regulatory bodies like the G20, the BIS,
    and the FSB have begun to stress the
    importance of not only sound policies
    – but global regulatory alignment.
    During this roundtable, we will discuss
    practical approaches for national and
    regional policymakers as well as the
    role of the industry in supporting this
    critical work.

While the cost of remittances worldwide is just below 7% according to World Bank data, the cost of remittances to Africa is especially high. At the same time, we find high mobile penetration and an understanding of mobile money and web3. In the workshop, we want to dive deeper into the African market microstructure, regulation, and opportunities for the web3 industry. We describe the conditions that technology must fulfill when it comes to user experience, to cross the chasm to mainstream adoption.'

  description: "There has been a recent surge in interest around both AI and blockchain technology. However, the question arises: Is there a genuine advantage to merging these technologies, or is it simply a passing trend? Blockchain holds the key to unleashing AI's true capabilities by introducing transparency and trust into a technology that has become integral to many aspects of our lives. Currently, there's a lack of insight and a means to validate the sources of data used to train AI models. This includes not knowing the exact data being collected, how it informs the model, and the resulting accuracy. By harnessing permissionless and open blockchain networks, AI systems can enhance their credibility, accountability, and security, ultimately fostering greater trust among users."

  title: "Zero compromises: An introduction to custom zk-powered blockchains'"
  hide_description: 'false'
  hide_speakers: 'false'
  description: "In this workshop we will show how and why launching a custom blockchain powered by zero-knowledge proofs is designed to meet any enterprise's specific needs. Advancements in the blockchain space, boosted by zero-knowledge technology allow enterprises to set up their own parameters around privacy, speed, data storage and much more with a seamless and fast launch process. These custom blockchains are private, but still benefit from being connected to the broader ecosystem for its users and liquidity. This opens up a world where entities can set up up custom permissions regarding the interoperability with the broader network."

  title: 'Banking on Crypto: Navigating new assets, new wealth'
  hide_description: 'false'
  hide_speakers: 'false'
  description: >
    Crypto was created as an alternative to,
    not for, banks. Still, it has turned out
    that banks have a role to play in
    crypto, be it for facilitating
    investment flows into the ecosystem, or
    by offering private banking services to
    the crypto wealthy. As a pioneer for
    integrating digital assets into wealth
    management services, we would like to
    discuss with you whether and how crypto
    plays a role in a wealth portfolio and
    what is needed to cater to the needs of
    traditional and crypto wealth.

  description: >
    This workshop explores the impact of
    quantum technologies on digital
    currencies and assets, with a focus on
    Bitcoin, Ethereum and Central Bank
    Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as studied by
    the Bank of International Settlements.
    We will dive into the challenges and
    potential of post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC), aiming to equip the audience with
    insights into the quantum security of
    decentralized networks.
