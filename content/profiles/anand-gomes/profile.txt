Bio:

Anand Gomes is the co-founder and CEO of Paradigm and Paradex. 

At Paradigm, he built the first institutional marketplace for crypto options, now the largest liquidity network in the industry, facilitating over $475 billion in lifetime volume and capturing 35% of the global crypto options market. 

Anand also co-founded Paradex, a high-performance decentralized exchange focused on bringing all finance on-chain. Since its launch in October 2023, Paradex has achieved $36 billion in lifetime trading volume with an average daily volume of $100 million across 55 live perpetual futures markets.

Before entering the crypto space, Anand helped build trading businesses across interest rate, commodities, and credit markets at KeyBanc Capital Markets. He holds an MBA/MS in Finance from Case Western Reserve University and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Pune, with early experience managing operations at a mid-market manufacturing company in India.

Anand’s interests reach beyond crypto—he’s drawn to alternative art, music (except country), distributed systems, mountains, and motorcycles, always pushing boundaries personally and professionally.
