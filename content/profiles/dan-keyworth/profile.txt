Bio:

Dan leads the technology portfolio across the McLaren Racing Team; one of three divisions
that falls under the globally recognised McLaren brand.

McLaren Racing is most known for its Formula 1 programme where technology plays a key
role in the Team’s ability to design, build and race competitively throughout the season. In
addition, McLaren has ventures in IndyCar and other emerging formulas where technology
plays a key role in providing the competitive edge engrained in the brand’s DNA.

Dan is responsible for all things IT on and off the track, from the core infrastructure and
business technologies used at the factory through to the bespoke capabilities McLaren takes
around the world to perform at the highest level in motorsport.

Dan works closely with the Racing leadership team to ensure the technology strategy is
aligned to the Team’s vision, complementing its journey back to the front of the grid and how
it operates under the new cost regulations introduced to F1 in 2021 and technical regulations
in 2022.

Dan has been with McLaren for 4 years after spending 9 years working for Fujitsu within the
UK Government delivering IT services into the Armed Forces. Prior to this, Dan was involved
in Fujitsu’s Global Services Team delivering enterprise service desks, engineering services
and management capabilities. He held several senior service management positions during
this time.
