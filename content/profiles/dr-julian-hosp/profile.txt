Bio:

After his successful career as a professional kitesurfer (ranking among top 10 in the world) and later as a trauma surgeon, Julian became a serial entrepreneur, bestselling author and keynote-speaker. He co-founded the Singapore based FinTech company TenX, which has developed a technology that makes cryptocurrencies spendable anytime anywhere and has raised USD $80 million in its ICO in June 2017. His German podcast “Die Krypto Show”, his YouTube channel “Dr. Julian Hosp” and his German blockchain community on Facebook “Kryptowährungen, Blockchain, Bitcoin - einfach, klar und ohne Abzocke” is each the biggest one in the blockchain world.

That’s also why Julian was named one of the top Blockchain and Cryptocurrency experts to follow by Influencive in 2017. He is a frequently invited speaker at global Tech/FinTech events as well as a regular commentator in the media on current blockchain trends, the future of cryptocurrency and best ICO practices.
