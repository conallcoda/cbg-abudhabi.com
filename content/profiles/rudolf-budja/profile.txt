Bio:

The Passionate Connoisseur Rudolf Budja

Art, sportscars and watches are known to be desired collectibles for passionate connoisseurs. Rudolf Budja, a man neither intrigued by price tags nor by numbers, is a re-known transatlantic art trader and lifestyle aficionado. Actually music was his first love. It helped kick off an exciting and fulfilling journey that he calls life. Nowadays, music remains to nourish the Austrian’s own creativity, but he has broadened his scope of sensual relationships to iconic artists, cars and other design masterpieces.

In the past 30 years, Rudolf Budja has dedicated his time and energy to collecting and trading art. Art has let Rudolf Budja grow from an 18 year-old Austrian DJ stranded in NYC’s nightclubs to a valued character in the international art scene. Similar to other great connoisseurs of passion assets, such as Francois Pinault,, Alice Walton, Jay Leno, Nick Mason or Shawn Carter better known as Jay-Z, Rudolf Budja trusts his instinct. Emotions lead him stronger than rational decisions. Feelings accompany his judgment on art just as much as on people that he choses to surround himself with.

His childlike affection is paired with constant vision of how to invest his time and energy. And it is sure to say that his natural talent has paid off. Understandably, the Austrian has set up a unique space that is home to international signature pieces. At Rudolf Budja Gallery Miami, select guests are welcome to indulge in anything from Andy Warhol originals to Golden Doughnuts, from a Steinway piano to a 356 Porsche. His Fine Art Dinners seat young artists, next to CEOs, homeless next to Dotcom billionaires. Where others see an area of conflict, Rudolf Budja recognizes opportunity. He filters through a simply binary code – like and don’t like.

What Rudolf Budja likes are interesting characters, good food and tasty wines. Experiences that money can’t buy are what he creates by exposing people he likes to things he likes in a setting that inspires him. This magic formula automatically generates engaging communication and bonding, both perfect conditions for growth. Yet, his hosting skills are not driven by business interest, but more by the outcome of having invested his time sensibly. Fortune or destiny, that his magic formula has also given him purchasing power to collect objects of desire.

As a trader he understands that emotional value is much stronger than monetary power. His currency overlaps different markets, people and assets. As a professional he notes quality as the key indicator for value enhancement.
