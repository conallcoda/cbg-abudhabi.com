Bio:

After completing a business degree majoring in finance at Murdoch University, Perth, Jemma joined J.P. Morgan in London. At the time financial markets were just starting to take sustainability seriously and had begun interrogating major projects on their triple bottom line.

Her job was to check environmental performance of clients and their ventures, while not degrading the profitability of the bank too badly. This was always going to be an interesting and nuanced task and brought plenty of internal soul searching and conflict.

As Jemma formulated her own thoughts on the matter she tried to raise the sustainability of relatively simple things like the bank's waste policy and found that nothing was straightforward, especially in large organisations.

Looking for a fresh challenge, Jemma extended her sustainability credentials with a PhD in electricity market disruption at Curtin University with a project that explored solar power in apartment buildings.

This PhD was in part an embryonic example of what is now a classic Powerledger theme, peer to peer sharing. Soon after completing the PhD, she and her co-founders, looked at blockchain technology and framed some of the ideas in the doctorate and put the new venture on a commercial footing. 

Since then, Jemma has developed numerous projects around the themes of  transactive energy, energy provenance and energy certification all of which are predicated on blockchain and crypto currency. Clients include eKwateur (provenance), M-RETS in the USA (certification), Chiang Mai Thailand with TDED (transactive).

Jemma is a regular contributor to Forbes magazine and a well known speaker at many of the industry conferences.

She lives in Perth with her husband, her 3 children and a dog called Dexter.
