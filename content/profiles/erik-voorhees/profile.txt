Bio: A crypto industry pioneer since 2011, Erik humbly suggests that there is no such thing as a “free market” when the institution of money itself is centrally planned and controlled. He’s the Founder of ShapeShift, a self-custody crypto interface which decentralized into an open-source DAO in 2021, and has been a featured guest on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, BBC Radio, Forbes, and dozens of crypto industry events.
