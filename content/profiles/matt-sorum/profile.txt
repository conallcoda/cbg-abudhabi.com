An appearance by The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in the mid-’60s would be a life-changing experience, and foreshadow the trajectory of his career which saw him being play drums with major band such as the Cult, Guns N‘ Roses and Velvet Revolver. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and won a Grammy with Velvet Revolver.
In recent years, Sorum has indulged his sense of community, tapping his musician friends for a number of star-studded side projects.
