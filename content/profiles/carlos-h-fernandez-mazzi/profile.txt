Bio: From complex commodities businesses, to large-scale sustainable investments and charity operations, Carlos has built considerable international business acumen over the past 30 years. With Finka, a Zug-based advisory firm which he founded, he leverages this experience with a passion for the promise of blockchain technology to lower the barriers of entry to global financial markets. A firm believer in blockchain as the catalyst for the evolution of finance towards new asset classes, Carlos is working to converge his impact investment background with the synergies of the Crypto Valley ecosystem and build sustainable projects at the crossroads of traditional and crypto finance. He is actively investing in productive assets that will issue creative financial instruments representing security tokens for the retail investor.
