Bio:

I am a Ph.D. student at the Professorship for Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain) and Fintech at the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Basel, Switzerland. 

My primary fields of interest include public permissionless blockchains, consensus protocols, and blockchain scaling solutions (Layer 2). I also explore specialized topics such as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), address clustering, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and the Metaverse.

I hold both an MSc in Business & Technology and a BA in Business and Economics from the University of Basel.
