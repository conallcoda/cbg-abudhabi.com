Bio:

Philipp is an entrepreneurial visionary, deeply-rooted in global strategy, operations and investments. Philipp has 12 years of experience in corporate value creation and operational excellence design & implementation, accumulated during his careers in management consulting (A.T. Kearney Strategic Operations Practice) and private equity (Merrill Lynch Principal Investing, Patria Investimentos/ The Blackstone Group, UBS).
Born in one of the largest favelas in Sao Paulo/ Brazil, Philipp has seen that uncertified but talented & skilled workers lack access to attractive corporate vacancies. But now, traditional employment models are vanishing and Philipp has committed himself to the enablement of skill- and talent-based micro-entrepreneurs — the largest global workforce of the near future.
