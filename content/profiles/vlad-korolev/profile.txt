Bio:

CEO and co-founder Vlad Korolev started Gunzilla from the desire to “make something that gamers want”. 

Vlad began his career in digital banking, running the commercial department of payment-processing company. He then launched a financial-tech startup, where he devised an integrated IT system to facilitates communication between banks and clients, which was used by 40+ banks.   

After an incredibly successful decade in Fintech, where he earned valuable experience in building cutting-edge tech from scratch, Vlad left to pursue his true calling… videogames. He entered the industry by combining his deep expertise in tech with a lifelong love for games, co-founding the popular matchmaking app PLINK with Alex Zoll. Following PLINK’s continued success (over 5 million users in the US alone), Vlad and Alex joined forces to found Gunzilla Games in early 2020.   

Vlad’s love for gaming is lifelong, having blossomed in 8th grade when he single-handedly launched a website offering free videogames. This passion, plus the comprehensive background in digital platforms and technology, demonstrates that he possesses the knowledge to lead a player-focused studio to its ambitious goals. He is also a partner and board member of GAMEGROOVE, ensuring Gunzilla has a strong financial and advisory foundation to build from.
